# Segmentally Boosted HMMs

Extend the concept of the segmentally boosted hidden Markov models as described in [Pei Yin's disseration](https://smartech.gatech.edu/handle/1853/33939) to unsupervised sequential classification.

The sequence classification code is taken from [Here](https://github.com/lichard49/Segmentally-Boosted-HMMs). Datasets can also be found there.
